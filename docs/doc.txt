**ChatEase - WhatsApp Bot POC Overview**


### pitch
"Good morning/afternoon. I’m part of the team working on a WhatsApp bot names CHATEASE which is designed to help small businesses answer repetitive customer questions — like order status, business hours, or pricing — automatically, without needing a human to reply every time."

"We’re also building a simple web dashboard where the business owner or staff can manage responses, view chat history, and control the bot — all without writing any code."

"The bot works using the WhatsApp Business API, and we’re using Node.js for the backend, and either React or plain HTML/CSS for the dashboard. It’s lightweight, user-friendly, and made especially for non-technical users."

"We haven’t started coding yet — this is part of our 45-day summer internship — but our team has already planned the tech stack, roles, timeline, and real-world use cases. Once we start, we’re confident we can deliver a working solution that’s simple, scalable, and actually useful for real businesses."

### Mock questions 

Q1: Why did you choose WhatsApp for this bot?
A: WhatsApp is the most widely used messaging platform in India and many small businesses already use it for customer interaction. By building on WhatsApp, we’re meeting customers where they already are.

Q2: How will the admin dashboard help?
A: It allows non-technical users to control the bot—edit replies, view logs, and monitor performance—without touching any code. This makes it accessible to shopkeepers, small teams, and solo business owners.

Q3: How is your bot different from existing ones like WATI or Twilio?
A: Most of them are paid, complex, or targeted toward large enterprises. Ours is lightweight, open for student demos, and includes an intuitive UI focused on local, real-world use.

Q4: What if the internet is down or the WhatsApp API fails?
A: We’ll implement offline message queuing and retry logic. The admin dashboard will notify the user if an API call fails.

Q5: What are the biggest risks or challenges?
A: The WhatsApp Business API setup can be a challenge due to approval delays. To mitigate this, we’ll start that process early, and if needed, simulate responses locally for demo purposes.

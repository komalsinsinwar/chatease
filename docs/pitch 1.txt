Good morning sir.
I’m Komal, and on behalf of my team, I’d like to thank you for this opportunity.
We’ve chosen to work on a project idea based on a WhatsApp Chatbot—a system where users can chat with a bot directly on WhatsApp for quick support or services.
now, we’ll share our roles and how we plan to build this project.

👩 Komal (yourself):

I’ll be working on the frontend development. I plan to create the chatbot interface—something clean and user-friendly, where messages can be typed and viewed easily by the user.

👩‍💻 Kaumudi:

Good morning sir. I’m Kaumudi. I’ll handle the backend development. I’ll be connecting the chatbot to the WhatsApp API using Twilio, and making sure it sends and receives messages smoothly.

👩 Harshita:

Good morning sir. I’m Harshita. I’ll work on the AI/ML part of the project. I plan to train the chatbot to understand user messages and give smart replies using natural language processing.

👩 Lakshita:

Good morning sir. I’m Lakshita. I’ll also be working on the frontend side, helping with the design, layout, and connecting the frontend to the backend.

🔹  Kaumudi – Problem Statement 

> Many small businesses get flooded with repeated customer questions.  
> Support teams often spend  3–4 hours daily  answering the same basic queries.  
> This leads to  slow responses,   high costs, and   frustrated customers .

---

🔹  Lakshita – Solution 

> Our solution is a  smart WhatsApp chatbot  that handles these repeated queries automatically.  
> It gives  instant replies, reduces the   workload, and improves the   user experience .  
> It’s also quick to set up and works directly on WhatsApp, where users already spend their time.

🔹  Harshita – Competitor Analysis 

> Tools like WATI, Zoko, and Yellow.ai already exist.  
> But they are often  too costly,   complex to use, or   lack flexibility .  
> Our bot aims to fix these gaps with a simpler and smarter experience.
